How to play

When you launch the game, you will be presented with a Menu window in which you have to enter your name, and the date. 
After you read the instructions, and you are ready to play, you just have to press Enter and the game is launched! 
The goal is to go to the small island across the map (once you are on the small island, you have to enter the light vortex in front of the house) as fast as possible, by jumping (Keypress J, hold it to jump longer) from rock to rock without falling in the poisonous water! 
When a trial is over (you either failed and touched the water, or you succeeded and reached the island), press the space bar to play again and launch another trial!
If you want to Pause the game, press Escape. This will freeze the game, then you can resume the game by clicking on the Resume button or quit the game and click on the Quit Game button.

Oh and one more thing. To make it more difficult, a black fog will sometimes appear on some trials...

Have fun (and don't fall) !

Notes :

All stones are now the same size for convenience 
New Web GL build : Loading and reading json files for RockData is now working !

4 levels of fogs : No Fog / Fog Level 1 = 28 / Fog level 2 = 42 / Fog level 3 = 56

To do : 

Find a convenient way to save continuous data for each trial on Firebase (most important)
Collision : Now saving where the avatar collided with a capsule collider mesh around each stone (want to save coordinates of each stones' center instead ?)
For now, randomly chosing fog level every trial (but maybe we should set it so all players have the same level of fog for each trial)
